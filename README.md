# *J*tris - A Game of Tetrominoes

This project is an implementation of a game mechanism popularized by Tetris® since 1985. This mechanism consists of a complex set of rules that governs the experience and the outcome of each gameplay. As such, it presents a series of challenges in designing, implementing, and testing the programs over the course of the project.

The Tetris® gameplay (which *J*tris implements) has shown beneficial effects to the human brain in a number of research studies. Such benefits range from improved critical thinking and reasoning[[1]](https://doi.org/10.1186%2F1756-0500-2-174), visual pattern recognition[[2]](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.290.5490.350), to the reduction of involuntary flashbacks to traumatic events for people with post-traumatic stress disorder[[3]](https://web.archive.org/web/20201101090805/https://www.nhs.uk/news/mental-health/can-playing-tetris-help-prevent-ptsd/). Thus, this project implements a game mechanism that is not only fun and captivating, but also suitable and beneficial to all kinds of people.
